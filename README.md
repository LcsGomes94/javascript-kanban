<p><img align="center" src="https://github.com/LcsGomes94/javascript-kanban/blob/master/JavascriptKanban.gif" alt="gif"/></p>
<br>

<strong>Main technologies used:</strong> <i>Javascript, HTML, CSS.</i>

<strong>Basic project.</strong> This is my first ever original project. Created with the purpose of proving to myself and to others that I could create something by myself, from scratch, and to show what I had learned after doing the courses for all the these months. This is a project to show my knowledge about DOM manipulation and programing logic using the web trinity.
